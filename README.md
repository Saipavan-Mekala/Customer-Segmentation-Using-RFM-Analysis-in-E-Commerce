<h1>Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis in E-Commerce</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project focuses on implementing <strong>RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis</strong> on an e-commerce dataset to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. The goal is to improve customer retention, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance personalized promotions.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring raw sales data.</li>
    <li>RFM Score Calculation:</li>
    <li>Recency (R): Days since the last purchase.</li>
    <li>Frequency (F): Total number of purchases.</li>
    <li>Monetary (M): Total amount spent by a customer.</li>
    <li>Customer Segmentation: Assigning R, F, and M scores for targeted marketing.</li>
    <li>SQL Query Optimization: Enhancing query efficiency for faster segmentation.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset contains <strong>150K+ customer transactions</strong>, including the following columns:</p>

    <li><strong>Customer_ID</strong>: Unique identifier for customers</li>
    <li><strong>Invoice_Date</strong>: Date of purchase</li>
    <li><strong>Purchase_Amount</strong>: Transaction value</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><strong>SQL</strong> for querying and updating sales data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results & Impact</h2>
